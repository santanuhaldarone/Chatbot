# 🧠 Simple QA Chatbot

This is a basic Question Answering (QA) chatbot built using:

- 🤖 Transformers (`deepset/roberta-base-squad2`)
- 🧱 Streamlit for the web interface
- 🔥 PyTorch backend

The app allows users to enter a custom context and ask questions based on that. It uses a pre-trained transformer model to extract the most likely answer from the context.
